# Contest solutions

This folder contains the solutions for all the contests we will be participating in. 

## Contributing

To add a solution to a given contest, you must follow the following guidelines:

- Create a branch and name it after the contest and problem you are solving. For example: "GranPremio1-A".
- Inside the folder for the given contest, create a folder for the problem you are solving named just with the letter of the problem.
- Inside each problem's folder, create the following:
    - A cpp file named just with the letter of the problem: A.cpp, B.cpp, etc.
    - One, or several, txt files with the tests that you used on your program.
    - A txt file with the compilation line you used.
    - A readme with the problem description.
    - Avoid uploading any binary files. One solution is to compile the code with the 'exe' extension, so that the gitignore ignores them.
